  # = The key to pagination
  # Arrays returned from paginating finds are, in fact, instances of this little
  # class. You may think of Leaf::Collection as an ordinary array with
  # some extra properties. Those properties are used by view helpers to generate
  # correct page links.

  #   require 'leaf/collection'
  #   
  #   # now use Leaf::Collection directly or subclass it

    # Arguments to the constructor are the current page number, per-page limit
    # and the total number of entries. The last argument is optional because it
    # is best to do lazy counting; in other words, count *conditionally* after
    # populating the collection using the +replace+ method.
    def initialize(page, per_page, total = nil, reverse_content = false)
      @current_page = page.to_i

    # Just like +new+, but yields the object after instantiation and returns it
    # afterwards. This is very useful for manual pagination:
    def self.create(page, per_page, total = nil, reverse_content = false, &block)

    # and redirecting.

      current_page > total_pages
    end

    # Current offset of the paginated collection. If we're on the first page,
    # it is always 0. If we're on the 2nd page and there are 30 entries per page,
    # the offset is 30. This property is useful if you want to render ordinals
    # besides your records: simply start with offset + 1.
    def offset
      (current_page - 1) * per_page
    end

    # current_page - 1 or nil if there is no previous page
    def previous_page

    end

    # current_page + 1 or nil if there is no next page

    # This is a magic wrapper for the original Array#replace method. It serves
    # for populating the paginated collection after initialization.
    #
    # Why magic? Because it tries to guess the total number of entries judging
    # by the size of given array. If it is shorter than +per_page+ limit, then we
    # know we're on the last page. This trick is very useful for avoiding
    # unnecessary hits to the database to do the counting after we fetched the
    # data for the current page.
    #
    # However, after using +replace+ you should always test the value of
    # +total_entries+ and set it to a proper value if it's +nil+. See the example
    # in +create+.
    def replace(array)
      result = super
      
      # The collection is shorter then page limit? Rejoice, because
      # then we know that we are on the last page!
      if total_entries.nil? and length < per_page and (current_page == 1 or length > 0)
